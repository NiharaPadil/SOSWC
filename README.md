This repository is the heart of the Sahyadri Open Source Women's Community (SOSWC), where we're all about fostering a community of empowered women in tech. As the President of SOSWC, I'm thrilled to present this space where we document and share all our activities, events, and initiatives. It's a hub of our collective efforts to learn, grow, and make an impact in the world of technology. Join us on this exciting journey, and let's support each other as we make strides in the tech industry together! ðŸ’«
